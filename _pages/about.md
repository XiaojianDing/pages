**Dr. Ding** received his Ph.D. (2011) from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China. He served as a visiting scholar at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) from 2009-2010. He was with the Laboratory of Science and Technology on Information Systems Engineering in Nanjing, China from 2011-2016, and with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China from 2016-2018. He regularly served as Program Chair or Reviewer for **ICLR**, **AAAI**, **NeurIPS**, and **ACM MM**. He is also a regular reviewer for over 10 IEEE Transactions journals including **TCYB**, **TNNLS**, and **TAI**, as well as many other SCI international journals. His current research interests include:

1. **Multi-modal machine learning** for integrative analysis of heterogeneous biomedical data.
2. Developing innovative **informatics methods and tools** to address data science challenges in biomedicine.
3. **Interpretable and responsible machine learning models** for clinical decision support.
