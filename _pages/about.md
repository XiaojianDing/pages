Dr. Ding received his Ph.D. (2011) from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China. He serves as a visiting scholar at School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the award of Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) from 2009- 2010. He was with the Laboratory of Science and Technology on Information Systems Engineering in Nanjing, China from 2011- 2016, and was with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China from 2016- 2018. He regularly served as Pragram Chair or Reviewer for ICLR, AAAI, NeurIPS, ACM MM. He is the regular reviewer of more than 10 IEEE Transactions journals like TCYB, TNNLS, TAI, and many other SCI international journals. His current research interests include: 1) multi-modal machine learning for integrative analysis of heterogeneous biomedical data; 2) developing innovative informatics methods and tools to address data science challenges in biomedicine; 3）interpretable and responsible machine learning models for clinical decision support.
